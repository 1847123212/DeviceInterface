DONE
- memory conversion from dict to list
- activate memory Rd and Wr buttons
- range check on memory fields
- strobes memory
- strobe write functionality
- hook update of internal value to memory view
- hook update of internal value to function view

======================================
= Crashes to solve

======================================
= Funtionality to implement
!- implement fpga register read
!- strobe read functionality

======================================
= Nice to haves
- readonly functionality
- add dirty flag to registers
- flash recently changed values in views
- make it happen that function view is updated when mem textboxes are changed, but no commited

======================================
= Code to clean up
- parse VHDL file at compile-time, so we can use ScopeStrobes.STR_ENABLE in code instead of strings
- indicate strobe write register in FPGA as REG_STROBES instead of fixed address
